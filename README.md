This is my version of The Odin Project's "Shopping Cart" project. I completed this project using the FakeStore API, React, Vite, Vitest and React Testing Library. The objective of this project was to practice testing react components, practice using React Router and also to keep practicing the react skills taught by The Odin Project. A full list of instructions can be found on The Odin Project's website (https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-react-new-shopping-cart).
